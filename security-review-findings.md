# Deep Security Review Findings (Historical Snapshot)

Date: 2026-02-10 (snapshot date)
Repository: `http-rfc-utils`

Status: superseded for current tracking.
Canonical security status document: `SECURITY_AUDIT_FINDINGS.md`.

Context:

- This file previously captured a source-focused deep review snapshot (`src/**/*.ts`) and an implementation-status narrative at that point in time.
- Security findings and current remediation tracking are now consolidated under `SECURITY_AUDIT_FINDINGS.md` to avoid split/contradictory status reporting.
- Historical references to chunk IDs (for example `C1-F1`) should be treated as archival identifiers, not current status markers.
