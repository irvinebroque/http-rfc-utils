# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Adding a changeset

When you make a change that should be released, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select the type of change (major, minor, patch)
2. Write a summary of the change

The changeset file will be committed with your code. When the "Version Packages" PR is merged,
the version will be bumped and the package will be published automatically.
